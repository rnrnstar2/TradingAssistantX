      Make strategic decisions considering:

      1. Account health and growth needs (current score: 85/100)

      2. Market trends and opportunities (0 opportunities available)

      3. Optimal timing for original post content

      4. Focus on original_post only - no other action types

      5. Risk management and quality control


      Return decisions as JSON array with this exact structure:

      [{
        "id": "decision-{timestamp}-{random}",
        "type": "content_generation",
        "priority": "critical|high|medium|low",
        "reasoning": "detailed explanation of strategic reasoning",
        "params": {
          "actionType": "original_post",
          "originalContent": "specific educational content",
          "timing": "immediate|scheduled|optimal",
          "expectedImpact": 0.0-1.0
        },
        "dependencies": [],
        "estimatedDuration": number_in_minutes
      }]


      Prioritize:

      - High-impact, low-risk actions for accounts with health score < 70

      - Opportunity-driven content for healthy accounts (score > 80)

      - Balanced approach for medium health accounts (70-80)

      - Quality over quantity always


      Limit to 3-5 decisions maximum for original posts only.
