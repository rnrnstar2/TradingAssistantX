# Output Management System

MVP-compliant output management system to prevent root directory pollution.

## üéØ Purpose

Prevents pollution of the root directory with analysis files, reports, and temporary outputs by enforcing structured output locations through automated validation and enforcement.

## üö® Critical Rules

### Absolutely Forbidden
```bash
# Never create files in these locations:
/Users/rnrnstar/github/ArbitrageAssistant/           # Root directory
/Users/rnrnstar/github/ArbitrageAssistant/packages/  # Packages directory
/Users/rnrnstar/github/ArbitrageAssistant/apps/      # Apps directory
```

### Forbidden File Patterns
```bash
# These patterns are forbidden in root directory:
*-analysis.md      *-report.md       *-output.*
analysis-*.md      report-*.md       output-*.md
*.tmp              *.temp            temp-*
debug-*            test-output*      *.log
```

## üìÇ Approved Output Locations

### Task-Related Outputs
```bash
tasks/{TIMESTAMP}/outputs/          # Task-specific outputs
tasks/{TIMESTAMP}/analysis/         # Task-specific analysis
tasks/{TIMESTAMP}/reports/          # Task-specific reports
tasks/{TIMESTAMP}/temporary/        # Task-specific temporary files
```

### General Outputs
```bash
tasks/outputs/                      # General outputs
tasks/analysis-results/             # Analysis results
tasks/temporary/                    # Temporary files
```

### App-Specific Outputs
```bash
apps/{app-name}/tasks/              # App-specific tasks
apps/{app-name}/analysis/           # App-specific analysis
apps/{app-name}/reports/            # App-specific reports
```

## üõ†Ô∏è System Components
